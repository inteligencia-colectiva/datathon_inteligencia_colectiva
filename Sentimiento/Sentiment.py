st.markdown (''' Predicting the number of stars that a customer will assign
              to a product is synonymous with understanding the sentiment of
              that customer towards their purchase. Therefore, the model's
              primary focus lies in forecasting the star rating a customer 
             will give to a product. This star rating prediction serves as 
             a foundation for sentiment analysis by simplifying categories.''')

st.markdown ('''The Transformer-based star rating classification model is 
             a cutting-edge deep learning architecture that excels at 
             understanding and analyzing textual content, particularly 
             for the task of classifying and predicting star ratings in 
             reviews or text-based data. The Transformer architecture 
             revolutionized the field of natural language processing by 
             introducing self-attention mechanisms, allowing the model to 
             weigh the significance of different words in a sentence based 
             on their context.'''

st.markdown ('''In the context of star rating classification, 
             the Transformer model leverages its ability to capture 
             intricate relationships between words, even within long 
             sentences. It processes the input text and extracts meaningful 
             features that contribute to determining the appropriate star 
             rating. By learning from large volumes of text data, the 
             model becomes adept at recognizing patterns, sentiments, and 
             nuances in language that correlate with different star ratings.''')
